<h1>ICT strand</h1>
<p>ICT is my chosen strand for this upcoming SHS. For the reason of, my mom wanted for it and kept telling me to take ICT as my strand. My brother also took
thisstrand and i guess watching for him learning is not a big deal for me to take ICT. At first, i really don't want to take ICT because as i said my brother also 
took ICT, much better if we have different kind of strand and work for the future, I want to hear from other people that  my mom has a son who is a Computer engineer
and a daughter of Nursing. If my mom never kept telling me to take ICT, I'll take STEM because that's where nursing begins. </p>
